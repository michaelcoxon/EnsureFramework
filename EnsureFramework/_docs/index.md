# EnsureFramework 
>*A simple framework to ensure variables and parameters*

## Hello

EnsureFramework is designed to take the pain out of null checking and making sure (ensuring) your methods are being used the way they were intended and throwing exceptions when unsupported values are passed to them.

You can make sure values are in a specific range or simply make sure that an argument is not null.

It was designed to be readable and fluent based, meaning you can chain ensurables together and the first one that fails will result in the exception.

## Get it!

EnsureFramework is available on NuGet. Just run the required command below:

# [Visual Studio Package Manager](#tab/Visual-Studio-Package-Manager)

```powershell
PM> Install-Package EnsureFramework -Version 1.3.0
```

# [.NET CLI](#tab/Visual-Studio-Package-Manager)

```powershell
> dotnet add package EnsureFramework --version 1.3.0
```

# [PackageReference](#tab/PackageReference)

```xml
<PackageReference Include="EnsureFramework" Version="1.3.0" />
```

# [Paket CLI](#tab/Paket-CLI)

```powershell
> paket add EnsureFramework --version 1.3.0
```
